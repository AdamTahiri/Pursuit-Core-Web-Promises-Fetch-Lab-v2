## 1. MVP

- A list of ten jokes that are randomly loaded when the page is refreshed, each with the `"card"` class
- Clicking on a joke card should expand it and reveal the punchline
- Clicking on it again should contract it and hide the punchline
- A button with id `"reload"` that refreshes clears all the jokes on the screen and loads new random ones

## 2. Bonus

- Have a select at the top for either `general`, `random`, or `programming` and only load jokes of that type
- Keep track of all of the jokes the user has seen so far, and don't show them the same joke twice when they click a button for new jokes
